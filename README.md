# Load Balancer Assignment

## Overview
You are working with a distributed microservices system. Each service has multiple instances (backends) that need to be load balanced efficiently. Your goal is to implement a **client-side** `Balancer` that distributes incoming requests among these instances. This means the load balancing logic resides on the client and chooses which backend to send the request to ‚Äî not the server.

You are provided with the following interfaces and helper constructors:

```go
type Request interface{}
type Response interface{}

type Backend interface {
    Invoke(ctx context.Context, req Request) (Response, error)
}

var _ Backend = &BackendImpl{}

// addr contains ip:port of a specific backend instance
func NewBackend(addr string) *BackendImpl

type Balancer struct {
    // TODO
}

var _ Backend = &Balancer{}

// addrs contains the addresses of all backend instances
func NewBalancer(addrs []string) *Balancer {
    // TODO
}
```

The `BackendImpl` is thread-safe.

You must implement the `Balancer` type to satisfy the `Backend` interface.

## Levels of Complexity
Start with the **Basic Level**, then continue with **Intermediate** and **Advanced** levels.

### üîπ Basic Level
- The balancer must implement the `Backend` interface.
- Distribute requests using the **Round-Robin** algorithm.
- Ensure thread safety.
- Handle errors returned from backend calls correctly.

### üîπ Intermediate Level
- Exclude consistently failing backends from rotation(you are free to use any failing method).
- Return backends to rotation after some time.
- Use well-structured methods and data separation.

### üîπ Advanced Level
- Distribute load based on how busy each backend is.
- A backend's load is the number of requests it is currently handling.
- You may use Go‚Äôs `container/heap` package to efficiently choose the least-loaded backend.

---

## Note on Backend Implementation
You are free to implement your own version of `BackendImpl` for testing and validation purposes. There are no restrictions or preferences on how this is done, as long as it satisfies the required interface:

```go
type Backend interface {
    Invoke(ctx context.Context, req Request) (Response, error)
}
```

Use your creativity to simulate behavior, errors, or different load conditions.

---

## Requirements
- You may add internal fields and logic inside `NewBalancer(...)`.
- Do not modify the provided interfaces.
- Your solution must be thread-safe.
- Implement the logic progressively (Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced).

## Evaluation Criteria
| Level         | Criteria                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic         | Round-robin logic, thread-safety, error handling                        |
| Intermediate  | Failure tracking and re-inclusion logic                                 |
| Advanced      | Dynamic load-aware dispatch using concurrent-safe counters or heap      |

---

## Submission
- Submit your implementation as a complete Go package.
- Make sure your solution has no race conditions.

## ‚ùì Is there any problem?

Please raise an issue or contact your instructor if:
- You‚Äôre unsure how to implement the eviction logic
- You need sample test cases or hints

---

### Run
```bash
   golangci-lint run ./...
```

Make sure your code is free of linting errors and warnings before submitting.

---

Good luck!
